Skipping numbers will result in an error. For example:\n*: Preference one: Dog\n*: Preference two: ''(blank)''\n*: Preference three: Cat\n* This is not allowed. Preference three cannot be added without adding preference two.\n* You cannot rank the same candidate multiple times. Ranking the same candidate multiple times will result in an error. For example:\n*: Preference one: Dog\n*: Preference two: Dog\n*: Preference three: Cat\n* This is not allowed. Candidate \"Dog\" was ranked twice.\n* You are allowed to change your vote during the election. This will overwrite your previous vote. You can do this as many times as you like.\n",
